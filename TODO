TODO:

- macro recorder
- script merge utility for when new gizmod versions get released
- PyOSD support?

BUGS:

- Potential Segfault in GizmodThread because ScriptMutex can not be 
  locked while in thread function.  Python Global Interpreter Lock 
  functions don't appear to work in embedded environment.  No known fix.
